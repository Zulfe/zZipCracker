[11/27/14]
Version 0.0.5:
	The entire project has been moved to a more OOP setup. The cracking and GUI components are now separate from the main functions. This should make things easier to read, less cluttered, and overall easier to debug.

	A spelling error in the user command list has been fixed.

	As of now, the dictionary builder has not been added. It will be added before the version 0.1.0 release.
